## 📋 What's in the Document

### **Core Strategy**
Instead of a basic overlay, I've designed a **modern hovering widget system** with:
- ✨ Glassmorphic floating containers
- 🎨 Neon animations (pulse, glow effects)
- 📊 Real-time transcript carousel with speaker badges
- 🚀 Collapsible Floating Action Button (FAB) in corner
- 💡 Smart insight cards with star/pin actions
- ⚔️ Battlecard widget for competitor intel
- 📈 Sentiment meter tracking call emotions

***

## 🎯 Why This Wins the Hackathon

**Differentiators over 50+ other teams:**

1. **Visual Impact**: Smooth animations judges IMMEDIATELY notice
2. **Production Feel**: Glassmorphism + neon = premium design language
3. **Real-time Intelligence**: Sentiment tracking + speaker ID = business value
4. **UX Polish**: Keyboard shortcuts, drag/snap, persistent layout
5. **Responsive Design**: Works on any screen size

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Antigravity IDE)

- **Next.js** (React framework)
- **Framer Motion** (animations)
- **Tailwind CSS** (styling)
- **WebSocket** (real-time connection to FastAPI)
- **TypeScript** (type safety)

## 🚀 How to Use This Document

1. **Open the file** in your Antigravity IDE
2. **Follow the 12-hour roadmap** sequentially
3. **Use component specs** as templates for your code
4. **Reference the design system** for colors/animations
5. **Deploy to Vercel** at the end for cloud demo link

***

## 💼 Key Features That Impress Judges

- **SpeakerBadge**: Visual speaker identification with confidence meters
- **TranscriptCarousel**: Live scrolling with auto-scroll + pinning
- **InsightCard**: One-click star to sync to Odoo CRM
- **BattlecardWidget**: Generate competitor intel on demand
- **SentimentMeter**: Real-time emotional tracking of call
- **SessionTimer**: Pulsing REC indicator + connection status

***

## 📱 Bonus: Fallback Demo Mode

Even if FastAPI backend has issues on demo day, the spec includes **mock data mode** so judges see full functionality using hardcoded transcript and local storage.

***

## ✅ Expected Outcome

By hour 12, you'll have:
- A production-ready hovering UI
- Real-time data integration with your backend
- Smooth animations that visually differentiate you
- Cloud deployment link to showcase
- Complete documentation for judges to understand architecture

**This positions you as the team that cares about UX while others focus on backend complexity.**
