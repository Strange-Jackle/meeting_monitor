Meeting Title: Q1 Technology Strategy & Infrastructure Review
Date: January 15, 2026
Attendees: Enric (CTO), Sarah (VP of Engineering), Mike (Lead Architect), Jessica (Product Manager)

Enric: Alright everyone, let's get started. The main goal today is to review our infrastructure costs and finalize the tech stack for the upcoming "FlowState" launch. Sarah, do you want to start with the cloud migration status?

Sarah: detailed update. We are about 95% migrated to Microsoft Azure. The reliability has been great, specifically with Azure Kubernetes Service. However, we are seeing some unexpected costs with Cosmos DB. The write units are higher than we modeled.

Mike: I noticed that too. I was reading on Reddit yesterday that a lot of people are complaining about the new billing model for Cosmos. Some are suggesting migrating non-critical data to MongoDB Atlas or even self-hosting PostgreSQL if we want to cut costs.

Enric: Let's not rush into another migration just yet. But Mike, can you do a quick POC on Supabase? I've heard good things about their developer experience. What about the observability layer?

Sarah: We are currently using Datadog. It's fantastic, but expensive. The logs ingestion bill is huge. I had a demo with New Relic last week, and they offered a pretty aggressive discount to switch.

Jessica: Sorry to interrupt, but from a product side, are we ready for the Salesforce integration? Marketing wants to announce it next week.

Mike: The API is stable, but we hit a rate limit issue during stress testing. We might need to upgrade our plan or implement better caching with Redis. Also, the Slack notification bot is acting up. It's delaying messages by like 5 minutes.

Enric: That's critical. Fix the Slack issue first. People live in Slack. If the bot is slow, they'll think our whole product is slow. Jessica, how is the mobile app testing going?

Jessica: It's going well. The iOS app is smooth. But the Android build on the new Samsung Galaxy S24 has some UI glitches. Also, the integration with Google Drive for file uploads is failing intermittently for enterprise users.

Enric: Okay, put the Android team on high alert. We can't have glitches on flagship phones. Speaking of enterprise, did we make a decision on the internal communication tool? relying on Zoom for meetings and Microsoft Teams for chat feels disjointed.

Sarah: The team really prefers Slack for chat. Moving to Teams would cause a revolt. But for video, Zoom is still the gold standard. I tried Google Meet again recently, and the quality just isn't there for large all-hands meetings.

Mike: One last thing. Security. I want to roll out 1Password to the whole engineering org. I'm seeing too many API keys being shared in plain text. It's a disaster waiting to happen.

Enric: Approved. Get the licenses. Security is non-negotiable. Also, did anyone see the launch of the Tesla Cybertruck 2.0? I'm thinking of getting one as a company promo vehicle.

Jessica: (Laughs) I don't know Enric, have you seen the reviews on Twitter? People are saying the range is less than promised. Might want to wait for the Rivian R2 instead.

Enric: Fair point. Let's stick to software. Okay, action items: Mike on Supabase POC, Sarah on Datadog vs New Relic pricing, Jessica on the Android UI bug, and everyone get on 1Password. Let's break.
